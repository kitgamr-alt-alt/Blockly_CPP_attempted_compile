This project has modified by three student at Kwangwoon University.

You can access the original project through the link below.
Or check out the project I forked.

## Project purpose ##

- A block editor allows you to visually check the c++ language and learn with reduced grammatical errors.
- It allows users to see that when coded into blocks, it translates into real c++ code and learn it.
- Use the example questions to try and debug coding using the functionality of the c++ language.

## How to use Blockly C++ ##
Blockly C++ can be used locally by going to demos/code and opening "index.html" with a browser.

## What the user should know ##
The problem with execution errors is that they are forced to transfer to c++ code in the original blockly development environment
 (following grammar such as javascript and python).
